          <span id="rules">The Dots is the game for two players.
The goal of the game is to capture at least 5 enemy's dots.
You can play either with other human player or a computer.<br /><br />
<span id="rules-points">Make a move:</span> Each turn a player places a dot of corresponding color on the board. The color of game title and the border indicate current player color (red or blue). Players are not allowed to place dots on other dots or inside captured areas.<br />
<span id="rules-points">Difficulty:</span> The game has 3 difficulty levels. The default difficulty level is Easy. Players have 3 seconds to take their turn. If a player fails to place a dot in the allotted time, the move will pass to the other player. Medium level allows 2 seconds to make a turn and Hard level only one second.<br />
<span id="rules-points">Capture:</span> When player's dots surround enemy dots these dots are considered captured. The captured zone became colored with player's color and is no longer playable. The captured zone became colored with player's color.<br />
<span id="rules-points">The game ends:</span><br />
- if one player captures 5 or more enemy’s dots<br />
- if all enemy dots are captured<br />
- if there is no valid position to place a dot and neither player had captured 5 enemy’s dots. (Draw)<br />
- if a player fails to place a single dot on the board for 3 consecutive turns and there is at least one enemy’s dot on the board
